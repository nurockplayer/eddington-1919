# Game Director Handoff

**Latest setup: 2026-10-19 JST** | Status: **reference pack written; no runnable Godot game, no gameplay PASS yet**.

## Canonical GitHub reporting entry

**[Issue #1 — Game Director Handoff](https://github.com/nurockplayer/eddington-1919/issues/1)**. Opus 5.5 should use it to record meaningful progress, playable builds and handoffs. A link to a commit/PR and honest playtest evidence matter more than a long status report.

### Read first (in this order)
1. [README](../README.md) — short owner direction and repo separation.
2. [Decisions](DECISIONS.md) — hard constraints and freedom.
3. [History and provenance](HISTORY_1919.md) — what can/cannot be claimed about 1919.
4. [Issue #1](https://github.com/nurockplayer/eddington-1919/issues/1) and its *latest* comments — the live director handoff.
5. [Earlier Notion slice concept](https://app.notion.com/p/3fdd7d8b39078183a159e6bd58fc0b7e) — optional inspiration, not a binding 2D/Hub specification.

## Target next deliverable

A **replayable Godot-native, solo 3D short scene**. Player moves/examines/interacts in a believable expedition environment, takes at least one meaningful observation-related action with a visible consequence, reviews available evidence and makes a judgment that another character/the world reacts to.

- **Minimum acceptance:** exact Godot version + launch command, actual runnable project/build, complete interaction path and restart, different reaction for a relevant alternate action or judgment, plus test/play evidence.
- **Not acceptance:** beautiful screenshots, a read-only history presentation, walking without a meaningful task, build green alone.
- **No need yet:** complete historical site, polished assets, full Hub, four-player networking, login, MMO infrastructure, content management system or elaborate reusable RPG foundation.
- **Autonomy:** Opus chooses player mechanics, camera, scripts, art, test approach, parallel task boundaries and feasible length; preserve the **playable action/evidence/judgment loop** and historical respect.

## How to report

At a meaningful milestone or before stopping, leave a compact comment on Issue #1:

`What actually works · commit/PR/build · how to launch/play · observed test results (incl. real gameplay) · historical/asset caveats · next highest-value step · owner/worker`.

Update this file with the latest verified state, link to playable scene/build and unfinished work. New sessions should read issue/latest main/handoff before editing. After merging a PR, re-run and verify the actual merged game before announcing completion.

## Separation from current work
- **Godot work here**: Eddington 1919 3D adventure slice.
- **Existing Web work elsewhere**: [unnamed-disease](https://github.com/nurockplayer/unnamed-disease) continues with the active Opus workstream, not interrupted by this new 3D request.
- Do not claim collaboration, ownership transfer, delegated agent runs or a build that has not actually occurred.

## First next action
Opus inspects available Godot build/test tools, chooses the smallest playable path and records a first succinct plan on Issue #1, then **implements and actually plays** that path. Avoid spending the first work session on more abstract architecture.
